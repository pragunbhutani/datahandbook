A data warehouse is a database optimized for analytics and reporting.
They are generally built using OLAP databases that are designed to store large volumes of data and query it quickly.
Data warehouses are typically updated in batches, rather than in real-time.

AWS Redsift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake and Clickhouse are examples of cloud-based data warehouses each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

You can also build your own data warehouses using open-source tools like Apache Druid, Apache Kylin, and Apache Pinot etc.

## Why Use a Data Warehouse?

In a typical organization, data is spread across multiple systems and databases.
A data warehouse allows you to bring all this data together in one place, making it easier to analyze and report on.
They are optimized for complex queries and reporting, making them ideal for business intelligence and data analytics.

Here are some more reasons to use a data warehouse:

- **Security**: Data warehouses are separate from your operational databases,
  which means you don't have to risk your operational or user-facing systems to run analytics.
- **Performance**: Data warehouses are optimized for analytics and reporting, making them faster and more efficient than traditional databases.
- **Scalability**: Data warehouses can handle large volumes of data and scale as your data grows.

## Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake

Data warehouses and data lakes are both used to store and analyze data, but they serve different purposes.
While data warehouses are optimized for analytics and reporting, data lakes are designed to store raw, unstructured data.

Data lakes generally offer more flexibility and scalability than data warehouses so you can store even larger
volumes of data, but they can be more complex to manage and query.
