Jaffle Shop has become a national brand with a presence in multiple cities and a large, loyal customer base.

You have a diverse team of specialists across all areas of the business, and data is at the core of everything you do.

You're focused on optimizing every aspect of your business, from product development to marketing to operations, using data-driven insights.

## Data Requirements

### Predictive Analytics

To stay ahead of the competition, you use predictive analytics to anticipate trends and
make proactive decisions.
By analyzing historical data to identify patterns, you use machine learning models to predict future
outcomes, such as demand for new jaffle flavors or the impact of a marketing campaign.

### Supply Chain Optimization

With a complex supply chain, you need to ensure that you have the right products
in the right place at the right time. You implement a supply chain optimization solution
that uses data to forecast demand, optimize inventory levels,
and streamline your logistics operations, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

To maximize the value of each customer, you implement a CLV analysis that helps you understand
the long-term value of your customers and identify opportunities to increase their lifetime value.
By analyzing customer data, you identify high-value customers and create targeted
strategies to retain and grow these relationships.

## Data Investments

### Data Lake

To support advanced analytics needs, you invest in a data lake that allows you to store and analyze
large volumes of raw data.
This provides your data science team with the flexibility to explore and analyze data in its raw form
and build more sophisticated machine learning models, driving innovation and deeper insights.

### Data Mesh Architecture

To decentralize data management and enable each team to manage their own data, you implement a data
mesh architecture. This involves setting up data domains and creating data products that can be
easily shared and consumed by different teams across the organization, promoting data ownership and collaboration.
