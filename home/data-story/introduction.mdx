Hello reader, this section is meant to serve as a basic orientation for those who are new to the world of data and analytics.
We'll be using a fictional startup called "Jaffle Shop" to illustrate how data can be used to make decisions in a business.

This, along with the [Core Concepts](/home/glossary/) section, will help you understand the basics of data teams,
how they work and meanings of some of the common terms used in the data world.

Start here if you'd like to understand what a data team does and how it fits into an organisation.
However, if you're already familiar with the roles and responsibilities of a data team, you might find this section
a bit too basic.
