Jaffle shop is now a well-known brand and you have a loyal customer base that keeps coming back for more jaffles.

You've hired a team of engineers to help you manage the issues with your website and you've moved to a more scalable
architecture that can handle the increased traffic and which allows you to deploy new features more quickly.

You have a design and marketing team that is constantly coming up with new ideas for jaffles and new ways to promote them.

You've invested in setting up cold storage and a distribution network so you can ship your jaffles to customers more efficiently.

You've set up a customer support team that is available 24/7 to help customers with any questions or complaints.

You also have a dedicated finance team that is responsible for managing the company's accounts and making
sure you have enough cash to keep the business running.

You've raised a Series A round of funding and have got all the pieces in place to scale the business to the next level.

## Data Requirements

### Product Analytics

You now need to understand which jaffles are driving the most sales so you can focus your marketing efforts on them.
You also use this data to decide which new jaffles to introduce and which ones to discontinue.

### Financial Reporting

As your business grows, so does the complexity of your finances.
You need to generate detailed financial reports to keep track of revenue, expenses, and profitability.

### Customer Acquisition Funnel

You want to understand how users are finding your website and what they are doing once they get there.
You set up a funnel that tracks users from the moment they land on your site to the moment they make a purchase so you can identify any bottlenecks in the process.

### Advanced Operations

As your operations become more complex, you need more sophisticated tools to manage them.
You implement an advanced operations dashboard that tracks key metrics such as inventory levels, order fulfillment times, and shipping costs.

## Data Investments

### Data Warehouse

With the increasing volume and complexity of your data, you need a more robust data infrastructure.
You set up a data warehouse to centralize your data from various sources, such as your SQL databases, Google Analytics, and CRM system.

### Basic ETL

You also implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to automate the movement of data into your data warehouse,
ensuring that it is cleaned and transformed for analysis.

### Business Intelligence

To enable more sophisticated analysis, you invest in a BI (Business Intelligence) tool that allows your team to create
interactive dashboards and reports.

This tool integrates with your data warehouse, enabling you to easily slice and dice your data to gain insights into your business.

### Real-Time Consumer Data Platform

You also invest in a real-time consumer data platform that allows you to track user behavior in real-time and unify data from multiple sources.
This platform also enables you to send this data to other systems, such as your CRM or marketing automation tools, to personalize the user experience.
